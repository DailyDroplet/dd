With a small amount of python, you can create your own painlessly.  Make sure you have python 3 installed, and packages qrcode, datetime, and reportlab. (If you don't usually typing "pip install qrcode" etc will install it for you. ) 

Open up the file code.py, and simply edit the "story1" "Url1" details etc, to put whatever headline and whatever you want.  Then open a terminal, open python within the terminal (usually by typing 'python' or 'python3') and then paste the code in.  The pdf file should be created in whatever directory you are in. 

Please fork and add your own stylings and have fun!
